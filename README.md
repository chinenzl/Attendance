## Student Management System

Welcome to the Student Management System project! This software is designed to manage student-related data within a school environment. The front-end development incorporates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the React framework. Additionally, the JavaScript library React-Bootstrap was utilized to enhance the user interface. On the back-end, the software is powered by Django, a Python-based framework. The database implementation relies on the lightweight SQLite3, integrated within the Django framework.

### Features and Permissions
The system provides three distinct account types: student accounts, teacher accounts, and administrator accounts. Administrator accounts have the highest level of access, enabling them to perform any operation on any account. Teacher accounts have the ability to add, modify, and delete student information, including student names, classes, courses, and attendance rates. Student accounts are restricted to managing their own account information exclusively.

We hope this software proves to be a valuable tool for school management and facilitates streamlined data handling. Feel free to explore and contribute to the project, enhancing its functionality and user experience.
